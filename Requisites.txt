## Server Info

- Realtime (websockets)
- LiteDB
- API:
  - Channel CRUD
  - Send Message
  - Get Server ID

## Web app

### Tech
- Vue
- App don't require login, all access info is saved on local storage
- English and Portuguese UI (portuguese is the priority)

### Send a message
- user must scan a QR code on the display server, that includes: Channel ID, Auth ID (from field on messages).
- this info will be saved locally on the display server, which will only allow messages coming from the Auth ID.
- App queries channel api to get channel info
- UI enables user to send messages following the template on that channel

### Message monitoring
- Scan QR Code with channel ID (no auth) - channel is added to list
- People monitoring the notification center can add a text to be notified about (regex)

## Display Server (Windows only):
- WPF Display server for showing notifications on another screen.
- Save Channel info locally - sync from server on startup
- Allow Channel CRUD
- Create/Save authorized devices to send messages on channel
